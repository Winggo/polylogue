# Polylogue

A figma-like editor representing an LLM conversation in a tree structure, enabling parallel conversations with the same dialogue context.
Each prompt & response pair can be represented as a node, and each node can be passed into different models.

The flow editor can be edited by multiple users simultaneously, and updated in realtime similar to figma.
This enables multiple participants in the same conversation with a LLMs.
